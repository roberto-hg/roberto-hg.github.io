I am a second-year MS student in the Computer Science Department of Cornell University, advised by <a href='http://home.bharathh.info/'>Bharath Hariharan</a> and <a href='https://web.stanford.edu/~udell/'>Madeleine Udell</a>. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Cornell University. My research interest lies in computer vision and machine learning. Currently, I am most interested in visual representation learning (self- and semi-supervised).
